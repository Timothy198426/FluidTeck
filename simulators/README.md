FluidTeck: Digital Models and Interactive SimulatorsThis directory houses digital models, simulations, and interactive demos that explore the principles and mechanics of FluidTeck. These tools allow for virtual experimentation, optimization, and visualization of the breath-cycle engine.Contents:fluidteck-sim.html: (Example) A basic HTML/JS simulation of the breath-cycle....and other models contributed by the community.How to Contribute a Simulator:Create a new sub-folder for your simulator (e.g., my_js_sim/).Include all necessary code and assets.Add a README.md describing the simulator's purpose, how to run it, and any key features or parameters."The air remembers what the machine forgets. These simulations help us remember and predict."
