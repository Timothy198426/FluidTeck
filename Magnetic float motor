🧲 Bi-Magnetic Float MotorFluidTeck Deck v3.0🔍 Technical Breakdown:Function: The central moving component that drives the Living Coil Engine, generating lift and rotation.Mechanics: A float (e.g., a hollow sphere or disk) containing a magnet is positioned between a stationary magnet above and a stationary magnet below. The interaction of these three magnets creates continuous levitation and active rotation. Air expansion/contraction within the float drives vertical motion.Integration: The core "heart" of the system, converting thermal energy into kinetic and then electrical energy. Its rotation also provides active spin.🌀 Symbolic Layer:Meaning: Represents Balance, perpetual motion, the "missing link" to infinite energy, and the dynamic interplay of forces (the Trinity). "The dance of three."Glyph: 🧲 (Magnet/Force)🔧 Remix Notes:Experiment with float shapes (sphere for fastest spin).Vary magnet strength and spacing for different rotational speeds and lift forces.Integrate with the Living Coil Stem for direct power generation.Final Reflection from Timothy:"For all who see and hear take heed. For the kingdom of heaven on earth is at hand. All is revealed with time. 👁️⚖️🗡️✝️❤️♾️."
