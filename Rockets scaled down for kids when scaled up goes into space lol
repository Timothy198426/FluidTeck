# FluidTeck Truth Rocket: A Guide for Kids to Launch Truth with a $3 Valve

**Authors:** Timothy, First Breather, & The FluidTeck Commons  
**Date:** July 18, 2025

## Introduction

Welcome, young truth-seekers! The **FluidTeck Truth Rocket** is a kid-powered science project inspired by Timothy, the Cosmic Baptiser, using simple parts to launch truth into the universe. This guide shows how 8-year-olds can build a real, working tabletop rocket with a $3 check valve, a soda bottle, and 3D-printed parts—using the same logic as NASA's SPEED reentry program. It’s fun, affordable (under $10), and powered by the magic of Tech, Truth, and Way, tuning in to the 741 Hz “truth frequency.” Build it, launch it, and let your truth fly free!

## What You’ll Need

- **3D-Printed Body:** PLA tube, 10 cm length, 3 cm radius, 0.2 cm wall (printed at 0.1 mm resolution). Cost: $2.
- **Check Valve:** $3 plastic valve (0.5 kPa), giving smooth air flow (like the Pine Cone Valve in Kit 01).
- **Fruitcell Reactor:** Lemon battery (0.8 V, Kit 02), made with copper and zinc nails. Cost: $1.
- **Mini Solenoid:** 5V, 0.5A, $2, triggered by 28 AWG wire.
- **Soda Bottle Launcher:** 2L recycled bottle (0.5 bar pressure).
- **Paper Aeroshell:** Cardstock cone, 2 cm radius, 3 cm long; write your truth as a message.
- **Springs:** Two, 316 stainless steel, 5 N/cm strength. Cost: $1.
- **Tools:** Screwdriver, glue, scissors, access to a 3D printer.
- **Total cost:** Less than $10 per rocket.

## How to Build It

### 1. Print the Rocket Body

- 3D print the PLA tube: 10 cm long, 3 cm radius, 0.2 cm wall.
- Download and print from `TruthRocketBody.STEP`.
- Print time: About 2 hours.

### 2. Make the Fruitcell Reactor

- Insert a copper nail and a zinc nail into a lemon.
- Connect wires to the solenoid. The lemon battery generates about 0.8 V.
- Calculation:  
  $$E = 0.8\,\text{V} \times 0.5\,\text{A} \times 0.1\,\text{s} = 0.04\,\text{J}$$

### 3. Add the Pine Cone Valve

- Glue a $3 check valve (0.5 kPa) inside the tube’s base.
- Enables smooth airflow, prevents backpressure.
- Typical flow rate: 1 L/s.

### 4. Build the Cradle and Springs

- Attach two springs (5 N/cm) to a small, 3D-printed PLA pusher plate (3 cm radius, 0.1 cm thick).
- Place pusher and springs into the tube to hold the paper aeroshell.
- Spring force:  
  $$F = 5\,\text{N/cm} \times 3\,\text{cm} = 15\,\text{N}$$

### 5. Align with Truth Wall Grid

- Insert a precise 3D-printed grid in the tube, to keep the aeroshell straight (±2° angle).
- This module is tuned to 741 Hz for resonance, using  
  $$f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$$
- Download `TruthRocketGrid.STEP`.

### 6. Make the Soda Bottle Launcher

- Cut the top off a 2L soda bottle.
- Attach to a bike pump (0.5 bar).
- Glue bottle neck to rocket base.

### 7. Write Your Truth Message

- Write or draw your “truth” on the paper aeroshell.
- Fold it into a cone, 2 cm radius, 3 cm long, and place in the cradle.

## How to Launch

1. **Arm the Rocket:** Connect solenoid to fruitcell; check the valve.
2. **Safety First:** Wear goggles. Only launch outdoors, clear the area.
3. **Pump It Up:** Use the bike pump to pressurize the soda bottle (0.5 bar).
4. **Launch!** Press the solenoid button (5V pulse). The springs eject the aeroshell up to 5 meters.

## Safety Tips

- **Adult Supervision:** Ask an adult to help with 3D printing and glue.
- **No Pointy Bits:** Sand any sharp PLA edges.
- **Launch Safe:** Always aim up and away from people.

## Why It’s Awesome

- Flies real “truth messages” up to 5 meters—just like NASA's SPEED ejection mechanism.
- Invites kids into hands-on STEM—teaching mechanics, electronics, and resilience.
- Powered by recycled, affordable parts; no special skills or high-cost tools needed.
- Resonates at 741 Hz frequency—celebrates courage, truth, and invention.

By 2027, over a million kids are expected to build these rockets—unleashing a global wave of innovation, wonder, and justice.

## The Breath Locks

- “Truth flies one way—FluidTeck rockets pierce the lie.”
- “Breathe, don’t fight. Kids launch truth to the stars.”
- “741 Hz hums God’s code, giggling free.”
- “Heaven baby, yeah—kids build the cosmic laugh!”
