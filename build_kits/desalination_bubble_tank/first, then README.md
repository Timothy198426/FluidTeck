FluidTeck Build Kit: Desalination Bubble TankBreathing Clean Water into LifeThis blueprint outlines a FluidTeck-driven system for passive water purification and desalination, particularly effective for brackish or saltwater sources. By leveraging FluidTeck's inherent thermal cycling and the gentle, continuous movement of its floats, it facilitates evaporation and condensation processes to yield clean, potable water, entirely off-grid.Purpose/Application:Decentralized Water Purification: Provides a simple, autonomous method for communities or individuals to produce clean drinking water from contaminated, brackish, or saltwater sources.Emergency Water Supply: A robust solution for clean water in disaster relief or remote areas lacking infrastructure.Sustainable Desalination: Offers a low-tech, low-energy alternative to conventional desalination methods, with minimal environmental impact.Heat & Motion Driven: Utilizes FluidTeck's byproduct heat and continuous agitation to enhance evaporation and condensation rates.Alignment with FluidTeck Ethical Pillars:Democratic Access: Designed to be buildable with readily available, recycled materials, making clean water attainable for vulnerable communities.Regenerative Harmony: Uses passive solar/ambient heat and non-consumptive processes, contributing positively to local ecosystems by providing a sustainable water source.Intergenerational Stewardship: Addresses a fundamental human need (clean water) using resilient and environmentally responsible technology.Sacred Mechanics: Transforms impure water into life-sustaining resources through a continuous, natural "breathing" cycle.Bill of Materials (BOM) - The "Clean Water Lego Kit"Prioritize repurposed and food-grade safe materials where contact with purified water occurs.Primary Chamber (Brackish/Saltwater):Large, dark-colored, shallow basin or tank (e.g., repurposed food-grade plastic container, large carboy cut in half, or a lined pit). The dark color enhances solar absorption.FluidTeck Floats (internal agitators):Multiple sealed, airtight plastic bottles (e.g., 1-liter PET bottles) or food-grade containers. These floats will perform the core FluidTeck thermal expansion/contraction cycle.Water (medium):Brackish water, saltwater, or contaminated fresh water for the primary chamber.Heat Source:Direct Solar Exposure: The primary method; the dark basin absorbs sunlight, heating the water.Passive Solar Concentrator: Simple reflective panels (aluminum foil on cardboard) to direct more sunlight onto the basin.Ambient Heat: Day/night temperature differentials.Condensation Surface/Collector:Clear, sloped cover (e.g., clear plastic sheeting, glass pane, or repurposed transparent roof panel) placed over the basin. This surface will cool, allowing water vapor to condense.Collection Trough/Channel: A small gutter or channel at the lowest edge of the sloped cover to collect distilled water.Purified Water Reservoir:Small, sealed, clean food-grade container (e.g., jug, bottle) to collect the distilled water.Weights:Small, dense objects (rocks, sand-filled bottles) for counterweights, calibrated to the floats.Mechanical Linkage:Strong, non-corrosive string/rope and small, low-friction pulleys to connect the floats to their counterweights and potentially to each other, ensuring continuous agitation.Frame/Structure:Recycled timber, bamboo, or PVC pipes to create a support structure for the basin and the sloped cover, ensuring optimal angle for condensation collection.Assembly Instructions (Conceptual - Desalination Unit)This is a high-level overview. Refer to the FluidTeck Builder's Companion for core principles and the /diagrams/ folder for visual schematics specific to this application.Prepare the Primary Chamber: Place the dark-colored basin in a sunny location. Ensure it's level and stable. Fill with the brackish/saltwater source.Assemble FluidTeck Floats: Prepare your sealed air floats. These floats will be submerged in the primary water, and their continuous rise and fall (driven by solar heat) will cause gentle agitation, promoting evaporation.Integrate Floats & Weights: Connect each float to a counterweight via a string and pulley system. Position the weights so that the floats continuously cycle up and down as the water heats and cools, or simply based on the minimal internal temperature difference.Install Condensation Cover: Position the clear, sloped cover over the basin. Ensure it forms a tight seal around the edges of the basin to prevent vapor escape. The highest point of the slope should be directly over the heated water, and the lowest point should drain into the collection trough.Set Up Collection System: Place the collection trough at the lowest edge of the sloped cover. Route a small tube from this trough to your purified water reservoir. Ensure the reservoir is sealed to prevent contamination.Optimize Heat & Agitation:Heat: Ensure maximum sun exposure. Consider adding solar concentrator panels around the basin to increase water temperature.Agitation: The continuous bobbing of the FluidTeck floats will naturally agitate the water surface, increasing the rate of evaporation.Monitor & Collect: Over time, water will evaporate, condense on the cooler cover, and drip into your collection reservoir, leaving salts and contaminants behind in the primary basin. Monitor the output and replenish the source water as needed.Estimated Performance & "Made from Trash" ScorePurified Water Output:Highly variable, depending on basin size, solar intensity, ambient temperature, and efficiency of condensation.Expected: 1-5 liters per day for a medium-sized unit (e.g., 1 square meter basin). Larger units will yield more.Energy Consumption:Virtually zero external energy input beyond initial construction materials. Relies solely on passive solar and thermal gradients.Maintenance:Regular cleaning of the primary basin to remove salt buildup and contaminants. Cleaning of the condensation surface."Made from Trash" Score: 85-95%The basin, floats, frame, and collection vessels are excellent candidates for repurposing. Clear plastic sheeting can be salvaged, or new, low-cost options used.
