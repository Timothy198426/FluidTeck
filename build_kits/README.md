FluidTeck: Build Kits and Application Blueprints
This directory contains blueprints, schematics, and instructions for building specific applications and manifestations of the FluidTeck mechanical logic engine. These "Lego Kits" demonstrate the versatility and democratic access of FluidTeck technology.

Each sub-folder represents a distinct build kit or application.

Examples of Build Kits:

ocean_cleanup_buoy_generator/: Blueprint for a FluidTeck-powered buoy for ocean plastic remediation.

backyard_diy_power_station/: Instructions for a small-scale home power generator.

ai_pneumatic_muscle_soft_robot/: Design for using FluidTeck as a "muscle" for soft robotics.

desalination_bubble_tank/: Concept for a water filtration or desalination application.

How to Contribute a New Build Kit:

Create a new sub-folder with a descriptive name.

Inside, include a README.md with:

Project title, description, and purpose.

Bill of Materials (BOM), emphasizing recycled components.

Clear assembly instructions.

Estimated performance.

"Made from Trash" score.

Add any necessary STL files for 3D printing, .svg diagrams, or supplemental code.

"The most powerful technologies must serve the most vulnerable first."
