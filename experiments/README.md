FluidTeck: Experimental Logs and Community Observations
This directory is the living record of FluidTeck in action. Here, builders, researchers, and enthusiasts share their experimental setups, observations, measurements, troubleshooting steps, and findings from engaging with FluidTeck systems.

We encourage all contributors to use the "Breath-Check Loop" methodology outlined in the Builder's Companion to document their process.
