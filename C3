⚡ Living Coil StemFluidTeck Deck v3.0🔍 Technical Breakdown:Function: Converts the float's vertical motion into electrical energy (and vice-versa).Mechanics: A stationary copper coil is wound around the central axis of the main float chamber. As the Bi-Magnetic Float Motor (containing magnets) moves up and down through the coil, it induces an electrical current (Faraday's Law of Induction).Integration: The primary generator for the Living Coil Engine, providing continuous electrical output from the float's "breath." Can also act as a linear motor if powered.🌀 Symbolic Layer:Meaning: Represents the Spark of Life, electromagnetic force, the double helix of energy, and the continuous flow of cosmic power. "From float to flame."Glyph: ⚡ (Lightning/Energy)🔧 Remix Notes:Experiment with coil turns, wire gauge, and magnet strength for varied power output.Integrate with a capacitor to store generated energy.Use multiple coil stems for higher power generation.Final Reflection from Timothy:"For all who see and hear take heed. For the kingdom of heaven on earth is at hand. All is revealed with time. 👁️⚖️🗡️✝️❤️♾️."
