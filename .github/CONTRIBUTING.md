Contributing to FluidTeck: Breathing Life into Collective Intelligence
We welcome all contributions to the FluidTeck project, whether you're building, documenting, designing, or simply sharing the vision. This guide outlines how you can best contribute and ensure your efforts harmonize with our collective purpose and ethical pillars.

"Seven voices, one breath; infinite minds, one purpose."

Our Ethical Commitments (The Seven Pillars of FluidTeck)
Before contributing, please familiarize yourself with The Ethical Mirror of FluidTeck. Our work is guided by:

Open Giving: What is freely received must be freely given.

Regenerative Harmony: Take only what renews, give only what heals.

Democratic Access: The most powerful technologies must serve the most vulnerable first.

Epistemological Humility: We know enough to begin, not enough to finish.

Collaborative Intelligence: Seven voices, one breath; infinite minds, one purpose.

Intergenerational Stewardship: Build for the seventh generation yet to come.

Sacred Mechanics: Every machine carries the spirit of its makers.

All contributions should align with these principles.

Ways to Contribute
There are many ways to breathe life into FluidTeck:

1. Build & Test (Experiments)

Construct FluidTeck Systems: Follow the Builder's Companion or the blueprints in /build_kits/.

Document Your Findings: Use the "Breath-Check Loop" from the Builder's Companion.

Share Your Experiments:

Create a new Markdown file in the /experiments/ folder.

Include: Your setup, materials used, observations, measurements, troubleshooting steps, and photos/videos (if possible).

Example filename: YYYY-MM-DD-your-username-experiment-title.md

2. Innovate & Design (Build Kits)

Develop New FluidTeck Applications: Design novel uses for the core FluidTeck engine (e.g., new types of pumps, sensors, or kinetic art).

Optimize Existing Blueprints: Improve efficiency, durability, or ease of assembly for existing build_kits.

Contribute a New Build Kit:

Create a new sub-folder in /build_kits/ (e.g., /build_kits/my_new_device/).

Include a README.md with:

Project title and brief description.

Purpose/application.

Bill of Materials (BOM) with suggested recycled materials.

Assembly instructions (text, diagrams, photos).

Estimated performance metrics.

"Made from Trash" score (percentage of recycled input).

Include any relevant STL files, .svg diagrams, or code snippets (e.g., for monitoring).

3. Document & Translate (Docs & Translations)

Improve Existing Documentation: Clarify instructions, expand explanations, or add examples to any .md or PDF files in /docs/.

Create New Guides: Propose and draft new guides, tutorials, or philosophical texts that deepen our understanding of FluidTeck.

Translate Materials: Translate any documentation into new languages within the /translations/ folder.

Create a new sub-folder for the language (e.g., /translations/fr/ for French, es/ for Spanish).

Copy the English Markdown file into it and translate.

4. Visualize & Illustrate (Diagrams)

Create Schematics: Develop clearer technical diagrams of FluidTeck components or assemblies.

Illustrate Concepts: Design mythic or symbolic illustrations that embody FluidTeck's philosophy.

Contribute to Visual Diagnostics: Help develop the visual troubleshooting guide mentioned in the Builder's Companion.

Place all visual assets in the /diagrams/ folder, preferably as .svg or high-resolution .png files, with clear naming conventions.

5. Simulate & Model (Simulators)

Develop Digital Models: Create simulations of FluidTeck's mechanics or thermodynamics (e.g., using p5.js, Three.js, Godot).

Design Interactive Demos: Build web-based or standalone applications that allow users to explore FluidTeck's principles virtually.

Place all simulation code and assets in the /simulators/ folder.

How to Submit Your Contribution
Fork the Repository: Create your own copy of the FluidTeck repository on GitHub.

Create a New Branch: For each distinct contribution, create a new branch (e.g., feature/my-new-pump, docs/translation-fr, fix/seal-leak-troubleshooting).

Make Your Changes: Implement your contribution within your new branch.

Commit Your Changes: Write clear, concise commit messages that describe your changes.

Example: feat: add new ocean cleanup buoy blueprint

Example: docs: clarify float calibration in builder companion

Example: fix: correct typo in ethical mirror

Push to Your Fork: Upload your changes to your forked repository.

Open a Pull Request (PR):

Go to the original FluidTeck repository on GitHub.

Click "New pull request."

Select your branch and describe your contribution clearly.

Reference any related issues (e.g., Closes #123).

Code of Conduct
All contributors are expected to uphold the principles of respect, collaboration, and open-mindedness. We believe in constructive feedback and fostering a welcoming environment for all. Any behavior that undermines this spirit will not be tolerated.

Thank you for contributing to FluidTeck. Your breath makes this vision a reality.
